<p><strong>What exactly is the HR transformation that the Siemens HR organisation is going through?</strong></p>
<p>Siemens HR Transformation is indeed a global transformation.&nbsp; Within the context of operating in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environment, and changes to our business portfolio, we need to evolve how we operate, our portfolio and most importantly our mindset as a global HR team.&nbsp; We have developed a set of global “Design Principles” that provide the framework for what we are doing – and it provides us with the blueprint to achieve the common vision we have of ‘Unlocking the Full Potential of our People’ across Siemens globally.</p>
<p><br>
	<strong>What are the goals of this exercise?</strong></p>
<p>There are three main cornerstones of our transformation: to be more agile, to increase the level of expertise, and to focus on what is core to the business.</p>
<p>Agility means thinking less hierarchically and leveraging the size, scale and capabilities of our global HR function: if we win a project in Egypt, we find the right people to deliver on the business requirements in Egypt.&nbsp; Another component of agility is to be able to turn services ‘on’ and ‘off’ as the business requires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Siemens portfolio is diverse, with a wide range of businesses all in different stages of growth and development.&nbsp; That means that requirements for HR differ and we need to be able to meet those various requirements without having stand-alone HR organisations for every business and every country.</p>
<p>Increasing the level of expertise is moving away from a generalist model and more toward a Centre of Expertise model. And expertise lies beyond the traditional areas like Compensation and Benefits. It now also extends to Shared Services and our HR business partners.&nbsp; Our goal is to bring the best market-driven, innovative solutions to the business, and that requires the right level of expertise.</p>
<p>Core to the business is the last driver of our transformation.&nbsp; Here we need to focus our portfolio on what is unique to and for the benefit of Siemens, finding where we can help Siemens create a competitive advantage.&nbsp; For other services, we will look to outsource.&nbsp; Traditionally, we have wanted to do everything in-house, but this concept forces us to be more thoughtful about how we staff our organisation, what skills we keep in-house, and where we can leverage expertise externally.</p>
<p><strong>How can these aims be measured before, during, and after the fact?</strong></p>
<p>We continuously track our spend-per-employee, our headcount ratios, and the like.&nbsp; We do annual business satisfaction surveys as well, along with a defined HR partner board made up of business and country CEOs and other stakeholders.&nbsp; We look at all these aspects as an over-arching measurement system to determine if we are on the right track.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one measure will tell the distinct story, but rather all combined tell us if we are progressing on our transformation… and most importantly, helping our businesses to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>What are some of the risks of attempting to change a global HR team only half-heartedly, or without the appropriate preparation?</p>
<p>We are about 5,200 HR employees globally, so building and maintaining the transformation is quite a challenge.&nbsp; The old adage tells us to “capture the hearts and minds”.</p>
<p>We have spent more time recently focused on these change elements to get the right level of buy-in and commitment to where we are headed.&nbsp; We also have a dedicated team which drives the topics, timelines, and content to ensure we are moving forward appropriately.&nbsp; The combination of dedicated resources and leadership commitment are essential to keeping us on track.</p>
<p><strong>What aspects of HR transformation will you be presenting on at the HR Transformation 4.0 Congress?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll be discussing the HR transformation journey at Siemens in more detail, looking at the whole story as well how and why we have been changing the mindsets of all our staff. The biggest take-away lesson is that the transformation is only successful if we ourselves can be agile and learn as we go along.</p>
