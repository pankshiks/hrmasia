<p>Responding to questions from <em>HRM Asia</em>, the fitness chain said that “all staff will be paid their salaries by this week/ early next week”.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson explained that “some issues” had caused its accounts to be held back since the announcement of the closures.</p>

<p>The spokesperson further clarified that staff would have been informed about the closure by their respective department heads.</p>
<p>Last week, True Fitness closed all outlet In Thailand and Malaysia with immediate effect.</p>
<p>With regards to Thailand, the company explained that “the past years have proved challenging, and unfortunately the business are no longer financially viable due to evolving market conditions.</p>
<p>“It has been a challenging market ever since the social upheaval with the flooding and military interventions. The local consumer market is still struggling.”</p>
