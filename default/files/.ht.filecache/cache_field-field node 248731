<p>Singapore is still first globally in “innovation input index”, and top five in all other pillars including human capital and research.</p>
<p>South Korea, the second most innovative Asian country and 11th overall globally, also maintains its top positions in patenting and other intellectual property-related markers.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top three in Asia is Japan, which increases two places to 14th this year. It is In the top ten for research and development (R&amp;D) and information and communication technologies.</p>
<p>China continues moving ahead in the overall ranking (22nd overall this year), reflecting high scores in business sophistication and knowledge and technology outputs. China this year displays a strong performance in several indicators, including the presence of global R&amp;D companies, research talent in business enterprise, patent applications and other IP‐related variables.</p>
<p>Within the Association of East Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping, Singapore is unsurprisingly the top performer in most of the indicators, with a few notable exceptions: ICT services exports, where the Philippines leads, and expenditure on education, where Vietnam leads.</p>
<p>Thailand’s strengths include creative goods exports and gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D financed by business, where it places 5th and 6th globally.</p>
<p>Malaysia, 37th overall, ranks well in high-tech imports and exports, university/industry research collaboration, and graduates in science and engineering.</p>
<p>Globally, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, the US and the UK are the world’s most innovative countries.</p>
<p>But key findings this year revealed that a group of nations including India, Kenya, and Vietnam are outperforming other economies at a similar developmental stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>India, in particular, is now a fast-emerging innovation centre in Asia. The study also found high innovation performance in Sub-Saharan Africa relative to development and an opportunity to improve innovation capacity in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Each year, the GII surveys some 130 economies using dozens of metrics, from patent filings to education spending. These indicators provide decision makers a high-level look at the innovative activity that increasingly drives economic and social growth.</p>
<p>Now in its tenth edition, the GII 2017 notes a continued gap in innovative capacity between developed and developing nations and lackluster growth rates for R&amp;D activities, both at the government and corporate levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Innovation is the engine of economic growth in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy, but more investment is needed to help boost human creativity and economic output,” said WIPO Director General Francis Gurry.</p>
<p>“Innovation can help transform the current economic upswing into longer-term growth.”</p>
