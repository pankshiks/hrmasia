<p>The <em>2017 GSK Global Pain Index</em>, which examined the impact of body and head pain on workplace productivity among other areas, found that Southeast Asian professionals were most likely to suffer in silence globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study, the first of its kind for Southeast Asia, found that productivity losses caused by pain had led to estimated productivity losses of US$44.6 billion (S$61.8 billion) across Singapore, Malaysia, The Philippines and Indonesia, or roughly 2.4% of the four countries’ combined Gross Domestic Product last year.</p>
<p>The biggest problem of physical ailments for most organisations, researchers found, is not employee absenteeism but presenteeism. Presenteeism happens when employees are physically present, but mentally disengaged at work.</p>
<p>That’s because most workers try to limit the impact of pain on their work commitments, with little understanding that not seeking treatment actually has a more detrimental effect on their work performance, says Heather Pelier, Southeast Asia Area Marketing Director for Pain Relief and Respiratory, GSK Consumer Healthcare.</p>
<p>When employees turn up at work in bad physical shape, overall company productivity drops by 15% because staff are unable to perform at their optimal levels.</p>

<p>Presenteeism cost Singapore businesses S$6.5 billion in 2016 alone on the back of 34.8 million lost man-days. This equated to 9.7 days working days lost per employed person.</p>
<p>One big cause of presenteeism, the study found, is the tendency for people to self-diagnose their pain and suffer in silence.</p>

<p>“Pain is very disruptive, not only for the individual sufferer, but extends to nearly all aspects of their lives. While headaches, body aches and migraines might not seem to have serious consequences, the index shows that if not managed effectively, pain can have a cumulative, national impact,” says Dr Yeo Sow Nam, Director of The Pain Specialist, Mount Elizabeth Hospital and Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.</p>
<p>“It is important that people take effective steps to address their pain,” he says, adding that education is key to getting to the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Professor Finkelstein says it is understandable that employees are always under pressure to perform, but the mindset shift should ultimately be driven by management.</p>
<p>“For my staff, I always tell them if they are not feeling their best, then it’s best that they don’t come in because you might expose the rest of us as well,” he says.</p>
