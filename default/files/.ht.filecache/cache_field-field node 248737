<p>Faithful+Gould will be investing up to S$2 million over the next five years to develop 16 high-potential project managers in deepening their skills for project leadership roles.</p>
<p>Atkins Acuity plans to invest S$2.5 million over the next five years on recruiting and developing 18 high-potential consultants, managers and directors in Singapore. The company will train these candidates in advanced infrastructure development, overcoming complex asset management challenges, and delivering solutions across the whole asset life-cycle for developing economies.</p>
<p>Faithful+Gould CEO Donald Lawson remarks that investment in skills development is essential in driving innovating and sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>“Specifically, with the advent of digital, we see an unprecedented momentum of change in the construction industry,” he says.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with EDB is empowering us to prepare for this change and build capacity and create job opportunities in Singapore while helping grow the infrastructure market.”</p>
<p>In recent years, Singapore has been recognised as a highly attractive market in the world for infrastructure investment thanks to its comprehensive infrastructure ecosystem, strong business environment, a healthy pipeline of development work and a growing economy.</p>
<p>But Singapore, like most Asian countries, face a shortage of skilled workers. A workforce with deeper infrastructure skills is needed to better capture growing opportunities and maximise its growth potential.</p>
<p>“Atkins Groups’ investment will help bring value to Singapore’s infrastructure ecosystem and strengthen our standing as Asia’s leading infrastructure hub,” says Fong Pin Fen, director for cities, infrastructure and industrial solutions at EDB.</p>
<p>“With talent as a key pillar of the sector, EDB looks forward to partnering Faithful+Gould and Acuity in not only growing its business, but also in the building up of skilled talent that will help fuel the industry’s growth.”</p>
