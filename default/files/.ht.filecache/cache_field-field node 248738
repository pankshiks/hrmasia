<p>Although 56% of employees surveyed said they prefer to wear more relaxed work attire, over 40% admitted they're at least sometimes unsure about whether clothing is office-appropriate.</p>
<p>Are jeans or t-shirts deemed proper? Or are they considered "too" casual?</p>
<p>This uncertainty led nearly half of respondents to choose donning a uniform over casual clothing so as to eliminate confusion altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those aged 18 to 34 (56%) have the greatest preference for formal dress codes. They're also most commonly unsure if their clothing is appropriate (54%).</p>
<p>More men (54%) also prefer formal attire than women (30%).</p>
<p>Still, nearly 90% of employees reported they like casual&nbsp;dress codes&nbsp;because they can wear more comfortable clothes.</p>
<p>However, about one in four respondents (23%) said their company policy isn't always clear about what attire is acceptable.</p>
<p>Employees were also asked to reveal something they've considered wearing to work but were unsure whether it was appropriate. Here are some of their responses:</p>
