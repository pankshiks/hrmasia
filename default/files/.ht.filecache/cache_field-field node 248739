<p>There is no doubt that the growing trend of working remotely is made possible due to easier access to modern technology and collaborative tools, fueling this shift and driving innovation.</p>
<p>Though remote work and virtual teams are regular features of the modern workplace, many managers still find supervising such arrangements uncomfortable. Their main concern: a perceived drop in productivity once an employee is set up outside the office.</p>
<p>The truth, however, is that with the right tools and guidelines, remote workers are often just as productive as employees who remain on site. Not to mention, the outcome is higher worker retention rates, lower HR costs and better work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may not recognise it, but most organisations are already working virtually, even when employees are in the office. Every day, people interact with colleagues on another floor or in a regional office.</p>
<p>Fortunately, managers already have several tools at their disposal to manage teams and ensure their work is getting done. The key is to measure progress just as you would with office-based teams based on the following five performance metrics that most managers are already familiar with. Here’s how they apply to virtual teams.</p>
<p><strong>Organisational KPIs</strong></p>
<p>Every year, businesses invest significant time, effort and resources in creating strategic plans and defining key performance indicators that are tied to achieving their business objectives. These define the expected outcomes of work. Although KPIs such as sales, customer satisfaction and customer retention are usually quantitative, they ultimately measure the quality and effectiveness of employees.</p>
<p><strong>Team targets and milestones</strong></p>
<p>Managers interpret KPIs and translate that into setting goals for their individual teams to meet those targets. One way to ensure your virtual team stays on track is to establish interim milestones and then hold the team accountable for reaching them. Missing these interim deadlines repeatedly is probably a good indicator of low productivity and efficiency. This will help managers to understand potential risks to project completion, before it becomes a full-blown delivery crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Individual objectives and performance management</strong></p>
<p>Each employee should have a performance management plan with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-Oriented, Time-Bound) objectives. With these objectives clearly articulated, employees – wherever they work – will know exactly what is expected of them and leaves no room for ambiguity. When remote workers consistently meet or exceed their objectives, managers can be confident they are working at an acceptable level of productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Process rules and guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Projects run more smoothly when expectations are clear, and that includes day-to-day processes. When processes are spelled out in concrete detail – how approvals happen, ideal timelines to wrap up each project stage – managers gain more definite metrics with which to measure and evaluate their team’s productivity. To ensure teams adhere to the defined processes, measure each step and hold members accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Communications metrics</strong></p>
<p>Effective and regular communication allows the blended workforce to understand their roles and responsibilities better. Regular project status meetings, both as a group and one-to-one, help keep projects on track. But managers should also measure the quality and quantity of communications.</p>
<p>For example, productivity and the quality of decision-making is reduced when team members multi-task during calls. Studies prove that video conferences lead to more effective collaboration and helps reinforce relationships and managers could establish a benchmark for the percentage of meetings held by video.</p>
<p>At the same time, be sure to optimise the communications process and provide remote workers with the right tools. For instance, web chat can be a valuable, virtual “water cooler”, and can lead to greater innovation, faster decisions and real-time problem-solving activities. Or, a unified communications system with an agenda tool can help improve meeting efficiency by making it easy to track time spent on each discussion item.</p>
<p>These quantitative metrics will help you evaluate the productivity of your virtual team, but it’s important not to lose sight of other, less tangible measures. The productivity of remote workers can be higher because they don’t have to deal with the stress of fighting long commutes or dealing with distractions in the office. This means they may have more energy and be more focused than their colleague in the office.</p>
<p>Remember, whatever can be measured can be managed - including employees.&nbsp;</p>
