<p>Kalanick, who took an indefinite leave of absence last week following a string of scandals in recent months, will remain on the ride-hailing company’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Kalanick was reportedly forced to resign as CEO due to mounting pressure from five of Uber’s largest shareholders, including renowned venture capital firm Benchmark.</p>
<p>Uber investors had wrote in a letter to Kalanick obtained by US media, ordering him to leave immediately as the company needed a change in leadership.</p>
<p>“I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Kalanick said in a statement to <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>He co-founded Uber in 2009 with Garrett Camp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A company spokesperson told <em>The Times</em> that Kalanick had “always put Uber first” and that his leaving would allow Uber “to fully embrace this new chapter”.</p>
<p>Uber had been plagued by controversy in recent months, including a report about its toxic and unhealthy workplace culture that led to Kalanick taking a leave of absence.</p>
<p>Uber’s troubles picked up steam earlier this year when a former engineer exposed the organisation’s habit of burying sexual harassment complaints.</p>
<p>She had wrote in a blog post that her then-manager made sexual advances towards her via Uber’s internal chat programme, but that HR did not enact any disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>Kalanick himself was caught on camera in March arguing with an Uber driver about the company’s poor driver incentives. He apologised later and said he would seek “leadership help”.&nbsp;</p>
