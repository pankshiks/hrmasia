	A great presentation does not just happen. It is planned, rehearsed then delivered with flair. A good presenter is one who learns the skills of presentations - not one who hopes for talent to carry them.<br />

	<span style=""color: rgb(139, 69, 19);""><strong>Introduction</strong></span><br />

	<br />

	The war for talents has been waging for years. There are no signs of ceasefire but rather in certain sectors and industries, the tension is far from over. So what now that you have candidates waiting to be interviewed by you and because of the talent war you select whoever that knocks on your door? It is an all-time dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

	&nbsp;<br />

	Jim Collins in his book,&rdquo; Good to Great&rdquo; used a great analogy of getting up a bus to exemplify the importance of hiring. His research suggested that great companies first decide&nbsp;who&nbsp;then what. That means that the quality of the hire is more important that what you want the candidate to do (job description is baseline). Usually with quality hire, they can definitely perform more than expected and beyond the job description. With wrong hire, it will cost at least 9 months of loss productivity and other associated costs.<br />

	&nbsp;<br />

	Hire right is important but how?<br />

	&nbsp;<br />

	Competency based interview skills workshop is the recommended solution for you. In this workshop, you will be expected to define what drives performance and how to achieve performance which is commonly known as competencies and you will be taught how to craft questions around competencies; set an interview framework around the questions and peppered with lots of practices. Also it helps to address a common mistake that most hiring managers&rsquo; commit which is to hire based on experience.<br />

	&nbsp;<br />

	Whether you are new in hiring or experienced hiring manager, this 2-day training workshop is designed for you.&nbsp; If you are exhausted using yester-years approaches, be refreshed with competency based interview skills workshop.<br />
