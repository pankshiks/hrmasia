Chan Hoi San, Senior Vice President – HR, shares how ‘StarHubbers’ shine from within.","<img alt="""" src=""/files/image/HRM/HRM%20148/Starhub.jpg"" style=""width: 280px; height: 250px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;"" />StarHub operates in a highly competitive landscape, and its success depends on how competent and passionate its people are in winning and retaining customers.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Hence, it is important that we first take care of our people, affectionately called &lsquo;StarHubbers&rsquo;, who, in turn, take care of our customers,&rdquo; says Chan Hoi San, Senior Vice President of HR for the telecommunications icon.<br />

<br />

StarHubbers come from diverse cultural, racial and ethnic backgrounds. This diversity truly adds to the strength of the telco, as such teamwork contributes many innovative ideas that are critical to the success of the business.<br />

<br />

StarHubbers also adopt an informal working culture. Everyone addresses each other by their first names, regardless of job title or function. Employees are encouraged to speak their minds, and to take the initiative to make changes that add value for customers or shareholders.<br />

<br />

Above all, everyone is expected to be treated with honesty, respect, dignity and fairness, Chan says.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;In our journey towards (becoming an) Employer of Choice, it is important that our people are positive, energised and excited about serving the customers,&rdquo; he says.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;And we make this happen by creating a workplace that reflects the vibrancy and excitement of the StarHub brand.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Shining at StarHub</strong><br />

<br />

At StarHub, growth is viewed as a self-driven process. &ldquo;Employees must take a proactive role in driving their own career development,&rdquo; Chan explains.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;They choose how fast and how far they wish to advance in their careers, and the company&rsquo;s role is to support and facilitate this journey to the best of its abilities &ndash; by equipping them with the relevant tools and development opportunities.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

StarHub&rsquo;s current job banding structure differentiates between two main career paths: the professional and the managerial paths. The career paths run parallel to each other, recognising that while jobs may contribute through different ways, they are equally valued by the organisation.<br />

<br />

The professional career path has been designed for &ldquo;subject matter experts&rdquo;. Roles in this career path are usually suited for individual contributors whose jobs are designed around profound experience and expertise.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Staff in the professional career path contribute to the company by applying their deep knowledge in specific areas, and by providing technical support and thought leadership to the organisation,&rdquo; Chan explains.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;The job holder can be a mentor to others.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

Roles in the management career path, on the other hand, usually entail people supervision or management responsibilities.<br />

<br />

Employees on this career path focus on managing others and providing people with leadership. These roles contribute to and achieve results through others.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Our employees can move from one career path to the other depending on job opportunities, individual aspirations, and person-to-role matches,&rdquo; Chan explains.<br />

<br />

To guide an individual on their own personal growth journey, StarHub has put in place a Career Development Framework.<br />

<br />

With the help of a supervisor and HR partner, an employee first undergoes a discovery process of reviewing their key strengths and development needs, and then identifies their career aspirations and job possibilities.<br />

<br />

Lastly, an action plan is formalised to help the staff member achieve those goals, with regular tracking of progress.<br />

<br />

HR also strives to strengthen its executive bench for leadership continuity. It creates a pipeline of future executives through the identification and development of talents at all levels within the organisation.<br />

<br />

Besides equipping them with opportunities for wider exposure at work, StarHub goes one step further by helping each of these talents gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their individual strengths, weaknesses and sources of motivation.<br />

<br />

This is done through self-assessment tools such as the Hogan Personality Inventory, Hogan Business Reasoning Inventory, BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory, and the 360-degree Feedback Survey.<br />

<br />

In addition, these selected talents get to attend career planning discussions with HR and the senior management team for closer alignment of their individual goals with business directions and objectives. StarHub also engages professional coaches for a period of up to 12 months for each employee.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;For high-potential development, we provide a holistic approach comprising three pillars to support talents in their development and accelerate career growth whilst enhancing their ability to contribute to StarHub,&rdquo; says Chan.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;The three pillars are &lsquo;Self-Discovery&rsquo; (self-awareness of strengths and leadership styles), &lsquo;Coaching Development&rsquo; (coaching and feedback sessions) and &lsquo;Career Development and Talent Engagement&rsquo; (project exposure and networking).&rdquo;<br />

<br />

Early last year, HR launched a Manager Ready (MR) coaching initiative as part of Starhub&rsquo;s Emerging Talents Leadership Development programme that aims to mentor and strengthen new mid-level managers.<br />

<br />

The tool allows managers to undergo a simulation assessment whereby they get to handle a variety of challenges and demonstrate their leadership competencies. After the assessment results, the managers partner with their respective coaching buddies to work on their development gaps.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Those who have been surveyed registered a 92% satisfaction level with the coaching programme, as they found that it led to an improvement in communication and engagement with their peers and subordinates,&rdquo; says Chan.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Training Starhubbers</strong><br />

<br />

Rapid technological change is the norm in the industry StarHub operates in.<br />

<br />

Therefore, continuously upgrading the skills and knowledge of employees is a must.<br />

<br />

StarHubbers received 71,066 hours of training &ndash; an average of 25 hours per employee &ndash; in 2013 alone. The telco spent $2.5 million on training in 2013, compared with $1.5 million in 2012.<br />

<br />

Through an extensive Learning and Development Framework, StarHub has significantly invested in in-house training programmes. These include the StarHub Essentials training modules that all employees are expected to complete.<br />

<br />

Specific sets of &ldquo;Key Programmes&rdquo; have also been developed for various job categories to meet their specific learning needs. Attendance at these courses is one criteria considered before promotions are offered.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Where new legislation is relevant to StarHub, we have also conducted in-house legal training for staff &ndash; to raise awareness of the obligations and implement for compliance,&rdquo; says Chan.<br />

<br />

For instance, in 2012, employees attended a number of New Media Development training programmes, seminars and conferences, including sessions on the Data Protection Act, social media marketing, mobile payments and the legal issues of cloud computing andbusiness contract law.<br />

<br />

Employees are also provided sponsorship opportunities for attending functional skills training, overseas training and conferences, certification courses, and executive management programmes.<br />

<br />

While line managers are responsible for identifying the training and developmental needs of their team members, individual employees are encouraged to also take responsibility for their own life-long learning.<br />

<br />

As such, training resources and learning roadmaps are readily available on the staff Intranet. Employees can easily check out the course schedule, sign up for workshops, and cross-reference the training needed to match their competencies at work.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Flexiwork at telco</strong><br />

<br />

While StarHub recognises that its employees work hard to support its business, the telco also wants to make sure hey have ample opportunities to have fun and pursue their passions outside work.<br />

<br />

This is done through an array of company-sponsored wellness activities, as well as volunteering, and other social and environmental initiatives.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We encourage and foster employee participation and involvement by organising a wide array of social and welfare activities throughout the year, such as lunchtime and after-work exercise classes, marathons, health talks, free health checks, and healthy eating workshops,&rdquo; Chan explains.<br />

<br />

Sports tournaments are also organised to boost morale and team camaraderie across various divisions.<br />

<br />

StarHub received the Silver award at the 2012 Singapore HEALTH Awards. Judges cited its continual excellence in workplace health efforts for employees.<br />

<br />

The company has signed a Health Pledge with the Health Promotion Board to implement its health promotion programmes in the workplace.<br />

<br />

StarHub believes that home is where the heart is and has taken steps over the years to improve work-life balance for employees.<br />

<br />

Examples of these initiatives include an early release from work on the last Friday of every quarter so that staff can spend more time with their loved ones and free credits to watch movies on the company&rsquo;s Video-On-Demand service.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We have also allowed staff early release before certain festivals such as Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, and Christmas,&rdquo; says Chan.<br />

<br />

These efforts have not gone unnoticed either, with turnover rates continuing to remain lower than those of other organisations within the telecommunications industry and national average (see: boxout).<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We acknowledge that Singapore&rsquo;s resilient economy and a tightening labour market have resulted in keen competition for a limited talent pool,&rdquo; she concludes. &ldquo;Hence, our approach is to continue to review and adjust our HR policies to remain an employer of choice.&rdquo;<br />

			&nbsp;<br />

			StarHub is a big proponent of Corporate Social Responsibility, and seeks to engage its employees in each of its outreach efforts.<br />

			<br />

			&ldquo;StarHub&rsquo;s spirit of volunteering and serving is imbued in our culture and is practised by employees at all levels,&rdquo; says Chan Hoi San, Senior Vice President &ndash; HR, StarHub.<br />

			<br />

			&ldquo;This volunteerism was formalised by the company since 2006, by providing each employee with up to two working days of paid volunteerism leave each year.&rdquo;<br />

			<br />

			Employees are able to take volunteer leave to participate in social outreach and pro-environmental events organised by StarHub or in which StarHub is participating.<br />

			<br />

			In 2013, employees volunteered a total of 212 days to support a number of social and environmental initiatives, up from 133 days in 2012.<br />

			<br />

			Organisations that have been supported by StarHub&rsquo;s corporate philanthropy as well as staff-led social outreach initiatives include: the AWWA Community Home for Senior Citizens, Food from the Heart, Moral Home for Disabled, and the Children&rsquo;s Cancer Foundation.<br />

			<br />

			Over the years, StarHub found that many employees were unable to take part in corporate social outreach activities due to busy work schedules.<br />

			<br />

			To address this, as well as to instil greater employee engagement across the organisation, the telco introduced the &ldquo;Sparkler&rsquo;s Initiative&rdquo; in January last year.<br />

			<br />

			This allows employees to create their own social outreach events, for which they can also tap on their volunteerism leave and receive up to $10,000 in matching funds for any donations they raise.<br />

			<br />

			&ldquo;Some of the Sparkler&rsquo;s Initiatives executed by employees have even engaged StarHub&rsquo;s business partners to raise funds for a designated charity,&rdquo; says Chan. &ldquo;Sparkler&rsquo;s Initiatives also aid in employee bonding within and between teams.&rdquo;</td>

			<br />

			&ldquo;In fact, our turnover rate continues to remain lower than those of the telecommunications industry (20.8%) and national average (25.2%),&rdquo; says Chan Hoi San, Senior Vice President &ndash; HR, StarHub.<br />

			<br />

			Fair and objective hiring practices, learning and skill development, career growth opportunities, a merit and performance-based reward and recognition system, and work-life balance initiatives all contribute to keeping the attrition rate low.<br />

			&nbsp;<br />

			&ldquo;Other than manpower issues, which is a perpetual challenge that we face, we note that employees are increasingly seeking more flexibility in balancing their work and family commitments, and expansion of company benefits for them and their loved ones,&rdquo; says Chan.</td>

<br />

I have been in management for more than 25 years. I have always dedicated my professional time to overcoming challenges. I&rsquo;m more of a developer. I like to keep moving from challenge to challenge, adventure to adventure.<br />

<br />

Because of this, I have been travelling extensively throughout my career, taking me through a variety of industries including contracting, real estate, sports goods, sports venue management, and telecommunications.<br />

<br />

I believe that so long as one is open-minded, and understands customers and staff, these skills are transferrable and one can move from one domain to another.<br />

<br />

I&rsquo;m extremely project-oriented and like to understand and immerse myself in any task I undertake.<br />

<br />

I dedicate all my time, passion and talent to achieving the outcomes of the job at hand. My entire career has been dedicated to taking on projects at different stages and seeing them through to the end.<br />

<br />

You could say I&rsquo;m more of a long distance runner than a sprinter!<br />

<br />

I&rsquo;m also rather hands-on as a leader. This comes from my experience in managing lean teams throughout my career. While I don&rsquo;t want to do everything myself and appreciate delegating work to staff around me, I prefer to have a short distance between them and myself.<br />

<br />

I prefer to have direct contact with most of the team on the ground; to listen to them; and to understand the kinds of issues they have to deal with. This allows me to provide my employees with the right resources and processes to help them complete their tasks well.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Where do you draw your inspiration from?</strong><br />

<br />

Having had more than a decade&rsquo;s experience in the sports industry, it&rsquo;s no surprise that I am inspired by football team coaches.<br />

<br />

I think it is one of the most difficult kinds of jobs and one that is very close to management. When you are coaching a team, you can&rsquo;t score yourself; neither can you be a goalkeeper yourself. You have to stay on your seat at the side-lines.<br />

<br />

First, you have to accept that without your team, you are nothing. It&rsquo;s all about the team you are managing. You can mould them by giving all the training you can but when the team has to deliver, and they have to do so without you at their back, alone.<br />

<br />

You have to trust your team.<br />

<br />

Secondly, you also have to accept that when the team is winning, the team is winning. However, when the team is losing, it&rsquo;s the coach that is losing.<br />

<br />

This is true also for business. The business leader, such as myself, has to take the rap for a failing team.<br />

<br />

Therefore, I focus on building a good relationship with my team and ensuring they are capable to complete the tasks at hand.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>You were with the French national stadium before this. How has that experience prepared you for your role here at the Singapore Sports Hub?</strong><br />

<br />

I was the CEO of The Stade de France (the national stadium of France) including during the 2007 Rugby World Cup.<br />

<br />

While I gained broad skill sets of how to drive the business as a &ldquo;Stadium Operator&rdquo;, taking over at the Singapore Sports Hub presented a different set of exciting challenges.<br />

<br />

The Singapore Sports Hub is more than a stadium. It is a unique, multi-sports, multi-themed, multi-tenant project. It boasts a number of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo;, including being Asia&rsquo;s first integrated sports, leisure, entertainment and lifestyle destination.<br />

<br />

The centrepiece of the Singapore Sports Hub is the new 55,000-seat National Stadium, the first stadium to be located within the city centre, providing spectacular views of the waterfront and Singapore city skyline.<br />

<br />

It is also the world&rsquo;s first stadium able to host rugby, cricket, football, athletics and concerts in the one venue.<br />

<br />

The Sports Hub is also at the forefront of technology and innovation, with the stadium&rsquo;s retractable roof and energy efficient bowl-cooling technology representing the next stage in sustainable stadium design.<br />

<br />

I relished the challenge of setting up the country&rsquo;s first full sports ecosystem.<br />

<br />

The move from France to Singapore also made me more aware of cultural and behavioural differences of patrons and presented the opportunity to manage a more Asian profile, as compared to the European-based patrons that I used to work with.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Such an esteemed project requires talented people to bring it to fruition. How did you hire talent to deliver what the Sports Hub promises?</strong><br />

<br />

The Singapore Sports Hub is no doubt a unique and new undertaking.<br />

<br />

Thus, finding the right talents for the jobs has proven challenging. While we have a very limited number of international expatriates, we do import international talent that has experience working at large sporting events such as the London Olympic Games and even the World Cup.<br />

<br />

In between working for such events, which come by once every four years, it&rsquo;s common practice for such experienced talent to travel and work in venue management.<br />

<br />

We tap on this specialised pool of people to complement our workforce at the Sports Hub.<br />

<br />

They are part of our succession planning programme, helping to train and mentor local staff so that one day, they can take over management of Singapore Sports Hub.<br />

<br />

For example, Gregory Gillin, the Sports Hub&rsquo;s senior director of stadia, has had extensive experience in managing pitches at world class venues including Wimbledon.<br />

<br />

He is currently mentoring a team of employees and transferring to them his knowledge of maintaining the specialised grass pitch at the National Stadium.<br />

<br />

Each event at the Stadium helps staff learn and grow in confidence and experience.<br />

<br />

Next, we look towards locally-sourced talent who are skilled and understand the Singapore context.<br />

<br />

These can come from a variety of industries to fill positions in departments such as HR, finance and legal.<br />

<br />

We have also hired local managers for some of our facilities, including the Water Sports Centre (Calvin Palayama, Director) and the OCBC Aquatic Centre (Lynette Ng, Assistant Manager). These leaders have had prior experience in sports venue management.<br />

<br />

The third line of recruitment comes from training non-experienced talent.<br />

<br />

While some universities offer degrees in sports marketing and such fields, there is no formal certification or degree in sports venue management.<br />

<br />

Nobody comes with a formal education in swimming pool management, for instance.<br />

<br />

More than half of our staff currently did not come in with any specific experience in venue management and were trained through our internal courses, and at local colleges and institutions that we partner with.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>I understand that part-timers make up a rather large part of your workforce as well. Tell me more?</strong><br />

<br />

With any event at the National Stadium, such as last month&rsquo;s Singapore Selection versus Juventus Football Club match, we have in the region of more than 3,000 full-time and part-time staff working.<br />

<br />

We invest in our part-timers and avail internal courses to train them in specific skills, including crowd management.<br />

<br />

This is important to us as we routinely host large-scale events. This is different from other stadia around the world where large sporting or other types of events are somewhat rarer.<br />

<br />

We are constantly developing new courses for staff to undertake.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>How do you ensure your diverse staff work together under one roof? Is there a culture that binds everyone?</strong><br />

<br />

Today, it is not a challenge to engage staff because everybody is happy to see the birth of this big baby, the Sports Hub, for which we have all been waiting for more than 40 months!<br />

<br />

We are like young parents. While we have our anxieties, we are also very excited.<br />

<br />

There is a sense of ownership amongst staff too. They like to show off the place they work, bringing their families to the Sports Hub on weekends and for events that we host.<br />

<br />

Singapore&rsquo;s first Public-Private Partnership (PPP), the Sports Hub project is also one of the largest sporting infrastructure PPP projects in the world today.<br />

<br />

Although it&rsquo;s made up of various outsourced companies, when asked who they work for, everyone says &ldquo;the Sports Hub&rdquo;.<br />

<br />

There is unison in our identity.<br />

<br />

Staff also like the atmosphere, the diverse sporting and entertainment events, and the fact that they are part of something historic in Singapore.<br />

<br />

Employees have the opportunity to move from working in retail to sports or non-sports venues to events coordination, and more.<br />

<br />

It will take a long time for anyone to get bored here!<br />

<br />

The perks of the job are also second to none.<br />

<br />

Staff regularly get to meet famous personalities, as if they are working in the movie industry.<br />

<br />

For instance, next month alone, some staff will get the chance to see, up close, tennis stars Li Na, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, who will be here for the Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association (WTA) Finals, and Mariah Carey, who will be here for her Me. I Am Mariah concert.<br />

<br />

For me, the most interesting person I&rsquo;ve met so far is the General Manager of WTA, Stacy Allaster.<br />

<br />

She&rsquo;s not a famous tennis player but the way she managed the tender to select Singapore as the five-year home for the WTA Finals was extremely professional.<br />

<br />

We look forward to maintaining this culture and energy for years to come.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

<strong>What are some challenges you face as the CEO of the Sports Hub?</strong><br />

<br />

Time! I hope to spend more time with staff. When the boss is not there, people are different. I hope to not only be my employees&rsquo; leader but also someone they can talk to almost as a friend.<br />

<br />

Also, it seems like in Asia, a meeting without 10 people is not a meeting! Sometimes it can be a challenge to ensure that these meetings are truly fruitful.<br />
