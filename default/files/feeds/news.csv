<br />

According to the <em>&ldquo;Future of Work: A journey to 2022&rdquo;</em>, report by PwC, nearly 75% of Indian respondents of the PwC survey said they want to be employed with a firm that illustrates social conscience, while only 26% appreciated a position that makes a difference.<br />

<br />

The survey showed that job security is most crucial for 53% of Indian respondents but 58% do not anticipate traditional employment to be present in the future.<br />

<br />

Approximately 42% of respondents claimed they wanted to preferably work for themselves, rather than any elite company while 81% are prepared to completely re-train themselves to remain relevant.<br />

<br />

The survey results revealed the formation of three unique &ldquo;worlds of work&rdquo; -- Blue, Green and Orange.<br />

<br />

The Blue World is where corporate rules and there is persistent pressure to perform. These elite companies recruit only the best and provide long-term job assurance and reward.<br />

<br />

However, only 10% of the total 10,000 viewed this as their ideal employer.<br />

<br />

The Green World represented caring firms that reassess their values and ambitions, possess a powerful social and environmental conscience, and whose values closely link with that of their workers.<br />

<br />

Approximately 53% of global respondents selected this as their preferable employer.<br />

<br />

Lastly, the Orange World eptiomised where small is beautiful and these companies break up into looser networks, linked together by technology, with social media increasing the connectivity.<br />

<br />

About 33% chose this as their ideal organisation.<br />

<br />

&quot;In the Blue World, HR will be at the centre of a hugely influential metric-driven strategy and performance function,&rdquo; said Padmaja Alaganandan, PwC India People and Change practice leader.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;In the Green World, HR&#39;s role could be much more diffuse, helping employees to shape their work around their values and outside lives.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

Alaganandan added that in the Orange World, HR is poised to possess a &ldquo;narrower recruitment and tendering role&quot;.","2014-09-09 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

<br />

This was the biggest readiness gap identified in Southeast Asia, according to the <em>Global Human Capital Trends 2014-SEA Report</em> by Deloitte.<br />

<br />

While 75% stated it is important to reskill the HR function, only 30% are actually ready to do so, resulting in a 45% gap.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;This is reflective of the changing expectations that businesses have of their HR functions,&rdquo; said Nicky Wakefield, Southeast Asia Human Capital Leader at Deloitte Consulting.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;HR teams need to move away from their historical role of being mainly operational.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

A Mateen, Vice President, HR, Singapore / South East Asia &amp; South Asia, DHL Express, believes that the pressing need for reskilling the HR function could be due to the fact that professionals are not immersing themselves enough in partnering with the business.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Whether HR people are engaged in business partnering with the organisation and supporting the business functions is a reason as to why companies see the need to reskill their HR departments,&rdquo; said Mateen in a phone interview with <em>HRM Asia</em>.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Many of these companies could be focusing on a narrower scope function and not integrating enough with the business.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

Wakefield explained that today&rsquo;s business climate needs HR strategies and operations to be in tandem and align with business goals, and that today&rsquo;s HR professionals should comprehend new practices, technologies, workforce changes along with the variances in culture, language and regulations in order to add value.<br />

<br />

On the global perspective, there was a 23% gap when it comes to reskilling the HR function.<br />

<br />

Another top worry among companies in Southeast Asia is in the aspect of building workforce capability.<br />

<br />

In total, 74% of Southeast Asian respondents cited it as an obstacle over the next 12 to 18 months, culminating in it being the top human capital challenge for the region.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Industries in the region are undergoing rapid technological, demographic and regulatory changes, and organisations now have to change their game from one of simply finding and building skills to one of deep specialisation,&rdquo; said Wakefield.<br />

<br />

Mateen also concurred with Wakefield.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We live in an ever-changing world and we have got to adapt and keep the workforce up-to-date and relevant as the business grows,&rdquo; he added.<br />

<br />

In terms of retention and engagement, 75% of Southeast Asian firms concurred of its importance, but only 45% are ready to tackle this aspect.<br />

<br />

For global HR and talent management and talent and HR analytics respectively, gaps of 31% and 40% were cited from a Southeast Asian perspective.<br />

<br />

Southeast Asian nations also identified five top human capital challenges.<br />

<br />

The chief obstacle was workforce capability (74%), followed by leadership (72%), retention and engagement (65%), learning and development (50%) and reskilling the HR function (45%).<br />

<br />

The report also showed that HR and talent programmes in Southeast Asia were awarded a C-minus for overall performance and this ranking is aligned with the overall global score.<br />

<br />

Only two percent of Southeast Asian organisations listed their HR and talent programmes report card as excellent, while 33% ranked it as good, 31% cited it as adequate, 20% listed as getting by and 13% claimed they were underperforming.<br />

<br />

In terms of HR investments in the next 12 to 18 months, 17% of Southeast Asian firms plan to significantly increase their investment (more than five percent), 44% aim to increase (one to five percent) while 33% plan to remain the same.<br />

<br />

Leadership also remains the number one talent issue confronting organisations globally and in the Southeast Asia region, with 74% and 76% of global and Southeast<br />

Asia respondents respectively acknowledging that it is of chief importance in their companies.<br />

<br />

Below half (38%) of the respondents in Southeast Asia believe they are high in readiness in terms of the leadership roles within their organisations, implying a 38% gap between importance and readiness, nearly similar to the global gap of 34%.<br />

<br />

The<em> Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends 2014 Report</em> featured the views of over 2,500 business and HR leaders in 90 countries worldwide.","2014-09-11 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

<br />

According to a recent Randstad Canada&#39;s <em>career management and personal branding survey,</em> close to half of Canadians (43%) said they would remain in a job that left them discontented if they were surrounded by a great team.<br />

<br />

When it comes to the aspect of managing their careers and being pleased at work, today&rsquo;s workers place a substantial amount of prominence on their personal network and working relationships.<br />

<br />

Possessing a good working relationship with co-workers even usurp good wages and benefits when it comes to assessing what makes a job enjoyable.<br />

<br />

To the question What makes you enjoy a job the most?, respondents cite great colleagues (52%) as the most crucial aspect, followed by trustworthy leadership (51%) and good pay and benefits (51%).<br />

<br />

Canadians are least enticed to the prospect of being in control, with only 32% claiming it was important.<br />

<br />

When describing career success, Canadians list doing what they love (45%) at the top of workplace success and rank making a specific wage at the very bottom of the list; 51% of respondents do not even deem wages as a success factor.<br />

<br />

The survey also show that 60% of Canadians have a firm idea about their career ambitions but are willing to source for different openings, while only 20% claim they possess clear goals and abide by it.<br />

<br />

According to Tom Turpin, President, Randstad Canada, the results highlights the distinct motivations and aspirations of today&rsquo;s job searches and workers.<br />

<br />

&quot;Today&#39;s Canadian workers are very connected, informed, mobile and flexible&#39;&#39;, said Turpin.<br />

<br />

&quot;The results seem to show that pursuing a leadership role or reaching a specific salary figure are not the main driving forces behind Canadians&#39; motivation at work.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

Turpin added that firms who want to entice and keep the best talent must pay a lot of emphasis to their internal communication schemes, team dynamics, and training and career development programmes, to keep their employees determined and passionate about what they do.<br />

<br />

Other highlights from the survey showed:

<ul>

	<li>28% respondents claim that they are inspired by innovative thinkers, and only eight percent say they are inspired by well-known, corporate CEOs</li>

	<li>Nearly 46% respondents say they never or almost never utilise a mentor to help them defining their professional goals, whereas less than a third indicating that they use a mentor</li>

	<li>When it comes to marketing themselves professionally, the majority of respondents (64%) claim they always or almost always rely on regular contacts with friends and colleagues, and 46% said they never or almost never use networking and events</li>

	<li>42% respondents say they do not use social media for professional purposes, but only for personal purposes</li>

	<li>Respondents feel that experience has a greater impact (39%) than education (13%) on their short and long-term career prospects</li>

</ul>

<br />

Just ask American workers.<br />

<br />

According to a new <em>CareerBuilder</em> survey, only about one third (34%) of employees aim desire leadership posts, with only seven percent targeting senior or C-level management roles.<br />

<br />

By an 11 percentage point margin, men (40%) are more prone than women (29%) to aspire for a leadership position.<br />

<br />

In fact, African Americans (39%) and LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) (44%) are more likely to covet for leadership posts than the national average.<br />

<br />

In addition, 32% of employees with disabilities aim for leadership positions, as well as 35% of Hispanics, both close to the national average.<br />

<br />

But why are employees keen to stay put in their current roles?<br />

<br />

A majority (52%) claimed they are simply contented in their present positions and a third (34%) do not want to sacrifice work-life balance.<br />

<br />

Education also emerged as a factor, with 17% claiming they do not have the required qualifications.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

One in five workers (20%) also believe that his or her company has a glass ceiling, an invisible obstacle stopping women and minorities from attaining higher lob levels.<br />

<br />

However, when viewing only employees who desire for management and senior management roles, the percentage rise to 24% and is even steeper among females (33%),<br />

Hispanics (34%), African Americans (50%) and workers with disabilities (59%).<br />

<br />

The notion of a glass ceiling is not as prevalent among LGBT employees aiming for leadership positions; 21% believe there is an obstacle to leadership at their company, slightly below the national average.<br />

<br />

In fact, only nine percent of non-diverse males believe there is a glass ceiling for women and minorities at their firm.<br />

<br />

Some organisations chose to deal with this issue directly, with 27% of employers&nbsp; having schemes to complement females chasing for leadership posts and 26% having initiatives to support minorities.<br />

<br />

In addition, 13% of workers at these firms think a glass ceiling exists.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;While most workers don&rsquo;t want a top job, it is important for organisational leaders to promote a culture of meritocracy in which all workers, regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation, are able to reach senior-level roles based on their skills and past contributions alone,&rdquo; said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at<br />

CareerBuilder.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;The survey found that employees at companies that have initiatives to support aspiring female and minority leaders are far less likely to say a glass ceiling holds individuals back.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

The survey was conducted online within the US &nbsp;by Harris Poll on behalf of <em>CareerBuilder</em> among 3,625 workers ages 18 and over between May and June.<br />

<br />

The poll consisted of employees in government and the private sector across salary levels, industries, and company sizes.","2014-09-15 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

&nbsp;<br />

The survey also indicated an increasing mobile usage in HR transactions such as training, employee directory and time and attendance, with 44% of organisations in India reported to be using or considering using mobile technology, which is higher than their APAC counterparts (36%).<br />

<br />

However, there is room to improve as organisations utilise mobiles for less than 25% of HR transactions.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

India is a fast-growing market and witnessing a faster rate of adoption of technology, said David Mitchell, APAC regional practice leader, HR technology, Towers Watson.<br />

<br />

&quot;India headquartered companies are more free to be innovative than global companies that already have established systems in place,&quot; explained Mitchell.<br />

<br />

Moreover, Mitchell added there is a relatively robust adoption of cloud- based technologies with close to 83% contemplating the use of cloud, a rate of adoption which is much faster than in the US.<br />

<br />

Moving ahead, Mitchell added that companies in India will focus more on talent management and that there will be personalisation of talent management system to very agile cloud-based applications or gaming apps.<br />

<br />

He said that companies are adopting gamification for performance management.<br />

<br />

However, the survey showed that many important HR processes in India, particularly talent management related procedures, are still manual/paper based, leaving space for more technology leverage in these key processes.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

According to latest data from the <em>Labour Market Second Quarter 2014 </em>report by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), retrenchments dropped while job vacancies also reached a record high.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The citizen unemployment proportion dropped to 2.9% in June 2014, while the resident long-term unemployment stayed among the lowest globally at 0.6%.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Hiring of locals also remained robust, with the 4.2% year-on-year growth in local employment in June 2014 (41,000 in 1H 2014) complemented by the ongoing steady rise in labour force participation of women and older residents.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The real median gross monthly income of fully employed citizens rose by 4.6% last year, according to the ministry.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

However, foreign employment growth continued to ease in the first half of 2014, leading to the moderation of total employment growth.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Foreign employment growth in the second quarter of 2014 (3,800) was the lowest since the third quarter of 2009 (700), contributing to lower year-on-year total employment growth of 3.8% in June 2014 (52,200 in 1H 2014, excluding Foreign Domestic Workers).<br />

<br />

Even though the figures are promising, the ministry cautioned of further firm closures as the economy continues to restructure.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;The key to firms coping with tighter labour market conditions and sustaining higher wages is through productivity growth,&rdquo; the report said.<br />

Irvin Seah, an economist with DBS, said companies are incurring higher labour costs due to the labour market crunch.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The survey <em>Wealth Insights The Rise of the Global Citizen</em> conducted by Barclays suggests that the prospect of securing and growing assets is one of the factors for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) to leave.&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Among the top reasons for high-net-worth individuals leaving the country include wanting to pursue an international career and looking for economic opportunity.<br />

<br />

China tops the list of destinations for HNWIs to move to. This is followed by the US and Canada.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

With Singapore&rsquo;s economy undergoing restructuring and growing business opportunities in China,<br />

However, while Singaporeans are looking to move out, the country remains an attractive spot for foreign HNWIs looking to do business here.<br />

<br />

Singapore received the most positive response globally when asked if they would recommend their company to a female friend according to the <em>eFinancialCareers </em>Diversity Survey conducted by eFinancialCareers.<br />

<br />

An overwhelming 87% of finance professionals said yes here, with Australia (83%) the UK and US (82%) close behind. The lowest responses came from professionals working in the Middle East (66%).<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We are seeing many of the local and international financial services institutions here developing gender diversity initiatives. Flexible working hours, childcare benefits and mentoring programs are among the most popular. They are proven ways to improve the gender balance and they also help attract top female talent,&rdquo; said George McFerran, Sales and Marketing Director at eFinancialCareers.<br />

<br />

While Singapore appears to be making positive strides when it comes to creating a female friendly environment, the survey also showed that more needs to be done in terms of equal representation and compensation of woman at senior levels.<br />

<br />

The survey revealed that while 89% of financial services professionals believe that women are equally represented at junior levels, only two-thirds (66%) of those surveyed believe that women are fairly represented at senior positions.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;Getting more women into senior positions is a priority for many financial services companies, and while many are spending a great deal of time and effort on this there is no quick solution. Another crucial step will be addressing the perception of unequal pay, it is damaging both&nbsp;for the industry and the people in it,&rdquo; added McFerran.<br />

<br />

Over two-thirds (68%) of the women polled believe that &lsquo;men are paid more than women in equivalent positions&rsquo;. &nbsp;When asked the same question, only 29% of men think &lsquo;they are paid more than woman in equivalent positions in financial services&rsquo;.<br />

<br />

Of those who believe that men are paid more than woman in equivalent positions in the financial industry, most respondents (44%) perceive there to be a 11 to 20% gap while just over a third evaluate the gap to be at 21% to 30%.<br />

<br />

Finance professionals have split views when it comes to the situation of the pay gap improving here with the majority believing that it will narrow in the future.<br />

A survey conducted by job site <em>CareerBuilder India</em> revealed that nearly 68% of employers have decided against hiring a potential employee after finding negative details about them on social media.<br />

<br />

The survey revealed that as many as 59% of employers are currently using social media to do their research on job candidates while good 33 % are also planning to access the platform soon.<br />

<br />

Common reasons for turning down a job aspirant were that job candidates were found to be lying about their qualifications (50 %), had poor communications skills (50%) and posted provocative or inappropriate photographs or information (47%).<br />

<br />

Other reasons also included drinking or drug habits (38%) and being linked to criminal behaviour (35%).<br />

<br />

She added that it was important for jobseekers to stay vigilant and pay attention to privacy updates on social networking accounts.<br />

<br />

Meanwhile, social media is also seen as &nbsp;a useful platform for employers to hire candidates with employers who were surveyed revealing that they are likely to hire someone if the individual&rsquo;s background supported their personal qualifications and if their personality was a good fit for the company&rsquo;s culture.<br />

<br />

Over 80 percent (82%) of the professionals who answered the <em>Morgan McKinley Working Hours Survey 2014</em> claimed they are working above the hours designated in their contracts which is slightly below Japan and Hong Kong (both 84%) but higher as opposed to China (65%).<br />

<br />

The survey also showed that close to two thirds (65%) of Singapore&rsquo;s professionals said they feel obligated to clock longer hours but only 28% believed they are more productive during these additional hours as opposed to their Asia Pacific counterparts in Australia (55%), China (39%), Hong Kong (37%) and Japan (36%).<br />

<br />

A staggering majority (85%) of respondents felt that excessive working hours are having an effect on their work-life balance.<br />

<br />

Despite this, Singapore&rsquo;s professionals are proceeding to work even when they are not present at the office, with 72% of respondents claiming they continue to work from home or on mobile devices.<br />

<br />

Even against the backdrop of the long hours working culture, the survey highlighted that just over half (54%) of respondents are aware of flexible work options at their company, with working from home being the most frequent (41%), followed by flexi-time (32%) and part-time (12%).<br />

<br />

However, over a quarter (26%) of respondents claimed there are presently no flexible work arrangements at their company, while 20% added they are unaware of flexible options given to them.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;This is indicative of the work culture across Asia, where typically longer working hours and late nights in the office are commonplace, so I&rsquo;m not surprised by the statistics at all,&rdquo; said Andrew Evans, COO, South Asia, &nbsp;Morgan McKinley.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Typically, in Singapore the workforce starts their day later than their western counterparts, and work lunch breaks are well enjoyed. It is culturally acceptable to enjoy a good hour for eating during lunchtime which does add to a later day&rsquo;s leave.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />

<br />

Evans said that more can be facilitated to boost flexibility to working hours by offices in the Singaporean landscape.<br />

<br />

He added that while the average professional in Singapore is committed to clocking long hours, their survey highlighted that many professionals are discontented with work-life balance aspects.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Unfortunately, there is not much choice at the moment,&rdquo; said Evans.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;While a minority of companies are able to offer working from home or flexi hours, clearly in the overall majority this policy is not currently implemented well or deemed acceptable by senior management.&rdquo;<br />

<br />

Morgan McKinley quizzed professionals in Singapore as part of the <em>Morgan McKinley Working Hours Survey 2014</em> in August 2014.<br />

However, 59% of employees here feel they could gain professionally from their parents&rsquo; wisdom and skillsets, according to the survey unveiled on Wednesday.<br />

<br />

The poll of over 1,000 professionals and parents of professionals in Singapore identified the top three causes as to why parents in Singapore have not revealed their knowledge with their children.<br />

<br />

A significant 38% of parents believe their children have not required it, 34Z% believe the working world has altered and that their advice is no longer suitable, while 28% feel the lack of knowledge of their child&rsquo;s career has impeded them from doing so.<br />

<br />

The research also highlighted that 46% of parents polled believe they can assist their children on the aspect of time management.<br />

<br />

This is steeper than the global average of 37% of parents who believe they can share time management skills, according to LinkedIn.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

In addition, 43% of parents in Singapore polled feel they can help in problem solving, while 39% claim they can assist in areas such as integrity and perseverance.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

&nbsp;The masterplan will look to keep the workforce relevant and meet industry needs. In order to do so, the WDA plans to strengthen partnerships with employer, industry associations, unions and training organisatation.<br />

<br />

This collaborative effort aims at enabling individuals to deepen their professional competencies, and advance in their careers based on the skills they gain.<br />

<br />

<strong>What to expect for CET 2020?</strong><br />

<br />

The CET 2020 masterplan outlined three areas of focus- developing increased involvement by employers in building and valuing skills; enabling individuals to make informed career choices and enhancing high quality learning of CET courses.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Under the CET 2020, WDA will work closely with sector lead agencies, employers and unions to co-develop &nbsp;manpower and skills plan for each key sector, in order to support industry growth and productivity efforts.</span></p>

It will identify the specific manpower and skills required for each sector over a five-year period and outline the measures to meet these requirements.<br />

<br />

WDA will also develop sectoral competency frameworks that will underpin the development of pre-employment training programmes offered by post-secondary education institutions.<br />

<br />

These frameworks will serve as a useful guide for employers to guide their HR practices such as recruiting and planning career progression pathways for their employees.<br />

<br />

&quot;The game changer is that the relationships will have to change. The roles of each of the parties involved will have to be different. Employers will have to step forward now and be more actively involved in defining the skills we need, defining the manpower requirements and also being involved in rolling out interventions. These include measures to attract, retain and develop their talent. Likewise for individuals and training providers,&quot; said Ng Cher Pong Chief Executive of WDA.<br />

<br />

The programme will also see the stepping up of efforts to reach out to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) including partnering with SPRING&rsquo;s network of SME centres to offer manpower and training advisory support. This will allow SMEs to gain a comprehensive suite of Government schemes that address manpower and skills needs.<br />

<br />

<b>Addressing challenges ahead</b><br />

Speaking at the launch of the new CET masterplan, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam spoke on the setting up of a new SkillsFuture Council to help Singaporeans develop skills relevant to the future and to build a future based on mastery of skills in every job.<br />

<br />

He pointed out that the biggest challenge for SkillsFuture is probably changing employment practices.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Changing the way in which industries recognise skills and working together amongst&nbsp;companies so as to be able to have a credible system, a credible skills framework that employees can identify with and employers and companies know it is worth something - it is not new to us but this is an area that requires development,&quot; said Tharman.<br />

<br />

He also &nbsp;addressed concerns by employers who are reluctant to invest in training for fear of losing staff which in turn leads to workers leaving their jobs and said that this &ldquo;vicious cycle&rdquo; must be broken and added that a sectoral or national skills framework will ensure a ready supply of skilled workers across the board which would benefit employers.<br />

<br />

He assured the Government will provide support resources and even funding so that Singaporeans can achieve success.","2014-09-18 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

This may affect productivity at work, according to the <em>Global Benefits Attitudes</em> survey by Towers Watson.<br />

<br />

The study shows that over half of employees claiming to experience high stress levels were also reported to be disengaged.<br />

<br />

On the contrary, only one in ten employees claiming low stress levels reported disengagement. Half of this group also claimed to be highly engaged.<br />

<br />

A notable 30% in the US claimed high levels of workplace stress. This was slightly lower than the reported 34% in the UK.<br />

The research clearly showed the destructive link between high levels of stress and reduced productivity,said Rebekah Haymes, Senior Consultant and Wellbeing Specialist at Towers Watson.<br />

<br />

Causes for high stress levels were also studied with more than half of employees surveyed citing inadequate staffing as the biggest reason.<br />

<br />

In the US, inadequate staffing was identified as the second largest cause after &rsquo;lack of work-life balance.&rsquo;<br />

<br />

&ldquo;If business leaders want to promote a lower stress environment in their workplace, it&rsquo;s vital that they understand the real causes of stress in their organisation,&rdquo; said Haymes.<br />

Highly stressed employees were also linked with higher absence levels at work taking an average of 4.6 sick days per year as compared to 2.6 days for employees with low stress levels.<br />

Consuming large amounts of coffee to get through the stress and strains of the day can lead to increase risk to your health causing you to suffer from strokes to anxiety to heart problems.<br />

<br />

This is the scenario endured by British office staff.<br />

<br />

According to the <em>Better Meetings survey</em> conducted by virtual meeting provider Citrix, UK office employees believe that more than a third of all meetings are a complete waste of time.<br />

<br />

The respondents in the survey claimed they spend an average of 3.3 hours in meetings daily, and many of them are not even worthwhile.<br />

<br />

Employees from the IT sector said half of all meetings they sat through were unproductive, those working in education believed 42% of meetings were pointless, while staff in financial services added that 40% of meetings were not required.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Workers deemed a meeting to be &ldquo;bad&rdquo; if no concise agenda had been formulated (70%), if it went off-tangent (56%), lacked fluidity (55%), attendees were inattentive (49%) or no decisions were taken (49%).<br />

<br />

According to the report published by Citrix entitled &lsquo;<em>The Insider&rsquo;s Guide to Better Meetings</em>&rsquo;, it revealed that teams organise and attend meetings out of routine.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Email has contributed to meeting proliferation by making it all too easy to invite a whole bunch of people to gather round a table by just hitting &lsquo;send&rsquo;, rather than considering whether the goal could be accomplished some other way,&rdquo; it read.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The report added that meetings were too lengthy, with the average person&rsquo;s attention span in a face-to-face meeting equating to 35 minutes and just 23 minutes on a conference, as well as being too costly.<br />

<br />

In addition, the report cited that conventional meetings can impede creativity and innovation.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;If someone introduces a novel solution or radical idea into a meeting, it often ends up going nowhere,&rdquo; it read.<br />

However the biggest leak in the pipeline for both Singapore and Malaysia remains between middle to senior level positions.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Women continue to be under-represented at senior levels in organisations and we need to continue to address this. However, overall these gradually improving numbers show that moving the needle and achieving greater gender balance, if not gender parity at all levels, is indeed an achievable goal in Asia.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;In particular, we commend Malaysia on its strong and improved performance&hellip;despite the less favourable environment for women&rsquo;s advancement in Malaysia; the country performs well on data points. These findings show that the existence of policies and programmes does not necessarily correlate to strong performance&hellip;,&rdquo; said Fern Ngai, CEO of Community Business.<br />

<br />

One area that Singapore is thriving in is in having flexible workplace arrangements.<br />

<br />

Findings in the survey revealed that Singaporean companies have excelled above the regional average in many respects especially in paid maternity leave and paternity leave. Flexible workplace arrangements are well established with nearly all companies offering this to their employees.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;In countries like Singapore, women-friendly and pro-family policies are fostering an environment that helps companies build great places to work,&rdquo; said Bernhard Steiner, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Asia Pacific Chief Risk Officer.<br />

<br />

A recent survey by Heldrich Center has revealed that 22% of workers who were laid off in the past five years have still remain unemployed.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

The report highlights that despite the drop in long-term unemployment recently, many Americans who are out of work are still struggling to recoup their wages and lifestyle.<br />

<br />

&quot;While the worst effects of the Great Recession are over for most Americans, the brutal realities of diminished living standards endure for the three million American workers who remain jobeless years after they were laid off, &quot; said Carl Van Horn, Director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.<br />

<br />

Though long-term unemployment has fallen, those that are hired only hold temporary or part-time slots, or full-time positions which pay less than their previous jobs.&nbsp;46% of workers who found full-time jobs said that their new jobs pay less than their previous one.<br />

<br />

The financial hardship is indeed greatest for those with long-term unemployment with more than four in 10 having to sell possesions to meet their daily needs. More than a fifth of them have also moved in with friends and family.<br />

<br />

The survey also revealed that despite their struggles, most do not benefit from the government assitance scheme at hand. Just 38% are receving unemployment insurance, and 83% of them who did get benefits lost them due to fidning another job.<br />

<br />

The survey was conducted with 1,153 Americans, about 300 of them have been unemployed for a long-term.<br />

Nearly one-third of workers in America report having felt bullied at work, according to a recent survey by <em>CareerBuilder. </em>What&rsquo;s worse is that roughly 20% of them have ended up leaving their jobs because of this.<br />

<br />

The survey revealed that 34% of woman claim to have been the victim of workplace bullying as compared to 22% of men.<br />

<br />

A notable 30% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) also reported to be bullied, at work, along with 44% of physically disabled workers.<br />

<br />

The study also revealed that 27% of African American workers and 25% of Hispanic workers also claimed to have felt bullied at work, as compared to 24% of Caucasian males.<br />

<br />

One of the most surprising takeaways from the study was that bullying impacts workers of all backgrounds regardless of race, education, income and level of authority within an organization,&quot; said Rosemary Haefner, Vice President of human resources at CareerBuilder.<br />

<br />

So who exactly are these bullies? 45% of the bullied workers have pointed out their boss as the main culprit, while 25% said it was someone higher up in the organisation, but not the boss. A sizeable 46% claimed to have been bullied by their co-worker.<br />

<br />

The survey also looked at the common forms of bullying which were reported.&nbsp; Being falsely accused of mistakes emerged making it to the top of the list of the most common form of bullying.<br />

<br />

Primary school teachers can also move towards subject specialisation to develop deeper content mastery and pedagogical skills.<br />

<br />

Educators of students with learning needs schools will also receive better support to enhance their knowledge and skills with an inaugural advanced diploma course by MOE.<br />

To further enable more experienced teachers to continue to grow in their jobs, the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) and schools will continue to facilitate various platforms and programmes in schools, and other cluster and zonal level learning platforms.<br />

<br />

Too good to be true? That&rsquo;s exactly the vacation policy at Virgin in both the UK and the US.&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">In his blogpost, Virgin Group founder&nbsp;Richard Branson, said he got the idea from&nbsp;Netflix inc, one of America&rsquo;s leading companies in the video rental business.</span><br />

<br />

Branson cited an article by the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, in which it was reported that salaried employees at Netflix got to take as much time off as they wanted to without being tracked.<br />

<br />

This Netflix initiative came about after employees recognised the old-fashioned way of taking time off was at odds with how they really&nbsp;performed their duties, having to respond to emails on weekends and working late nights at home to solve problems online.&nbsp;Since Netflix was not tracking the actual hours employees were logging in each work day, employees felt that the same should apply for holidays.<br />

<br />

This was given a nod by the management. &quot;We should focus on what people get done, not how many hours or days worked. Just as we don&#39;t have a nine to five day policy, we don&#39;t need a vacation policy,&quot; said the company&rsquo;s <em>Reference Guide on our Freedom &amp; Responsibility Culture</em>.<br />

<br />

The company has since scraped its formal plan of tracking employees&#39; leaves and today workers can take their vacation for as long as they want as long as their managers are aware that their duties will be covered.<br />

<br />

The concept of freedom, trust and responsibility seems to be working well for the company.&nbsp;According to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, Netflix which was launched in 1999 now has a market cap of nearly $7b while it&rsquo;s biggest rivals Blockbuster, was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.<br />

<br />

Branson said depending on how well the policy works out in at Virgin&#39;s UK and US parent companies, he will encourage other subsidiaries to follow suit.","2014-09-24 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

<br />

SPRING Singapore and two new accelerators will look to co-invest some $60 million to boost the growth of medical technology start-ups.<br />

<br />

&nbsp;Zicom MedTacc and Med Tech Alliance, the two new accelerators, will look to identify and invest in promising medtech ventures and offer hands-on assistance programmes for businesses.<br />

<br />

Both these accelerators were appointed through Spring Seeds Capital Pte Ltd (SSC), the investment arm of SPRING Singapore.<br />

<br />

With a $30 million fund managed under Spring&rsquo;s Sector Specific Accelerator (SSA) programme, SSC will look to co-invest with the two accelerators on a 1:1 basis. This will bring the total funding to at least $60 million for the medical technology sector.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Entrepreneurs in the medical technology field are often technically and scientifically proficient, but they may lack the know-how and support in developing a market-ready product in this highly complex and regulated environment. The two new accelerators, backed by established corporate players, will shorten the learning curve and optimise the start-up&rsquo;s chances of success, given the access to funds, deep engineering capabilities and regulatory know-how, as well as market network,&rdquo; said Tan Kai Hoe, Chief Executive of Spring Singapore.<br />

<br />

He said that the inclusion of Zicom MedTacc and Medtech Alliance on board the SSA programme will build on the early but positive traction to nurture and develop the nascent sector.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that the new accelerators will groom high-potential medical technology start-ups and entrepreneurs under their wings, to quicken their growth pace and enable longer-term success beyond Singapore shores,&rdquo; Tan added.<br />

Med Tech Alliance comprises two corporate investors Accuron Technologies, Greatbatch Inc and Lu Yoh-Chie, who is the Executive Chairman of Biosensors.<br />

The company, a Shanghai-based startup operating in Singapore, has caught flak online for all the wrong reasons after posting an ad to hire a Lead Software Engineer.<br />

<br />

Here&rsquo;s what the company listed in the &lsquo;Who We Want&rsquo;? section of its job ad:<br />

<br />

&#39;You are ambitious, intense and entrepreneurial, and you dream of doing truly epic shit with your life. You recoil at the thought of having 1.15 kids, balloting for a flat, saving up for a Toyota and waiting to withdraw your CPF savings at 65 (or 70, or 80, or 120).&#39;<br />

<br />

The company also listed down what they weren&rsquo;t looking for in a &lsquo;Who We Don&rsquo;t Want&rsquo; section:<br />

<br />

&#39;You are a shallow social climber whose dream is to work for Goldman Sachs because it &quot;looks good on your CV&quot;. You went to an Ivy League university because it would &quot;look good on your CV&quot;. But you couldn&#39;t get into Goldman Sachs (or Citibank, or HSBC) because you actually have no passion for finance, just like how you want to buy that Louis Vuitton bag (because it will &quot;look good on your social CV&quot;) despite having no passion for design and craftsmanship. Guess what? If you were rejected by Goldman Sachs, you will be rejected by us too. For exactly the same reasons. Advice: try applying for a government job.&#39;<br />

<br />

&#39;You are a social misfit. You like technology only because you can&#39;t relate to real people. You spend your weekends playing DOTA and in your sleep you dream about your hero reaching Level 38. At school, you were always the last to get picked on any project or sports team. Having a conversation with you is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Advice: go seek help from a mental health professional.&#39;<br />

The job ad sparked controversy online. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d seen some horrible job ads, but that is the worst!&rsquo; said Craig Read, a twitter user.<br />

A company in Holland is taking special efforts to reinforce work-life balance to ensure staff don&#39;t continue working late.<br />

<br />

To achieve this, the Amsterdam-based design studio Heldergroen is using the concept of a &#39;disappearing office&#39; to reinforce work-life balance, as reported by lifestyle publication <em>Trendhunter</em><em>. </em>How&rsquo;s that for creativity?<br />

<br />

At 6pm each day, desks are literally lifted to the ceiling with the use of a key-operated lifting mechanism and steel-ceiling cables. All paperwork left on the desk will return in the same position the very next day when they return to work.<br />

<br />

Employees are encouraged to use their office space however they like after 6pm, just as long as it isn&#39;t work-related. This could mean putting on their dance shoes and using the office space as a dance floor or perhaps, even a yoga studio.<br />

<br />

With the topic of work-life balance coming under the spotlight recently, Heldergroen&rsquo; s &lsquo;disappearing office&rsquo; concept should set more companies thinking about innovative ways to achieve work-life balance.<br />

KPMG has teamed up with Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks to address the issue of inaccessibility with sees London&rsquo;s housing market made available to all but the highest earners.<br />

<br />

This initiative was unveiled to staff last week. It is part of the private banking package for employees that include preferential mortgage rates that is negotiated by KPMG.<br />

<br />

The issue of inaccessibility to the London housing, even to young well-paid employees has come under the spotlight recently, but little seems to have been done to address the issue.<br />

<br />

According to the Financial Times, it is understood that mortage brokers have said that corporations are unlikely to sign up to commitments which are long-term such as guaranteeing the housing debts of employees who may eventually leave.<br />

<br />

For Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, the move was indeed a success after having beaten rival banks in the tendering process to earn a contract with KPMG.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

The initiative opens the opportunity to access a larger group of new customers.<br />

<br />

KPMG believes that the cost of buying property has been one of the factors that is stopping younger workers to move to London and this is affecting the ability of companies to retain talent.","2014-09-26 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

This is according to latest findings of a survey released by Singapore Business Federation (SBF).<br />

<br />

In its survey conducted in 2013 with about 3,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the SBF said that the challenge of promoting productivity was mainly due to the lack of right manpower in these companies.<br />

<br />

The survey also revealed that 85% of the companies polled were worried about labour costs. This was 13% per higher than the 72% that was polled the year before.<br />

<br />

However there were some encouraging signs for companies which tapped on IT for productivity, with 86% seeing benefits within the first year.<br />

<br />

To drive productivity, SBF and the Singapore National Employers&rsquo; Federation will be organising the National Productivity Month starting October 7. The event will have conference that will showcase and demonstrate productivity initiatives.","2014-09-26 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

<br />

Foreign employment growth was mainly driven by the construction sector, with two-thirds of foreign employment growth coming from this sector.<br />

<br />

This was highlighted in a recent annual report published by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD).<br />

<br />

The report also noted that as a result of the moderation in foreign employment growth, Singapore witnessed the slowest growth in the last decade, with the total population only growing by 1.3% from June 2013 to 2014.<br />

<br />

Singapore&rsquo;s total population now stands at 5.47 million as at June this year.<br />

<br />

Singapore&rsquo;s non-resident population has also slowed down to 2.9% down from 4.0% in the previous year. This comprises individuals holding work passes, dependents and international students.<br />

<br />

Going forward, the report cautioned that businesses will continue to face a tight labour market as Singapore looks to restructure its economy. The Government will help businesses, grow and succeed, to create quality jobs for Singaporeans, the NPTD said.<br />

<br />

More than 5,400 executives and employees were surveyed in 27 countries which included Australia, China, India and Malaysia.<br />

<br />

Companies in the region are ahead in workforce training and mentoring but are still behind when it comes to talent management and adopting new technology.<br />

<br />

The survey also identified millennials-those born in the 1980s or 1990s- entering the workforce as the top labour market shift &nbsp;that will affect workforce strategy.<br />

<br />

Asia Pacific companies are failing to fully recognise talent management changes that will be required, the study revealed. Only 27% executives in the region view long-term loyalty and retention as part of their talent strategy.<br />

<br />

Creativity and problem-solving skills also ranks low among executives at about 5%, making it half of the weight given to these worldwide.<br />

<br />

For employees in Asia Pacific, defining opportunities for career development is the most important factor to increase loyalty and engagement (46%), followed by more comprehensive benefits (45%) and higher compensation (44%).<br />

<br />

The study also shows that millennials are more similar to non-millennial coworkers than expected, with almost the same percentage of millennials (21%) and non-millennials (24%) likely to leave their jobs in the next six months.<br />

<br />

As the influx of young, ambitious employees join the workforce across Asia Pacific, it is critical for companies to recognise that their talent management practices and policies will need to evolve,&rdquo; said Adaire Fox-Martin, President of SAP Asia Pacific Japan.<br />

<br />

Although the need for skills such as analytics, cloud and programme/development is expected to grow sizably over the next three years, less than half of employees are expected to be proficient in these areas during this timeframe.<br />

<br />

Executives also note an impact, but to a lesser degree as &nbsp;on required investments in HR technology and HR policy. Only 28% of executives have ample data about the workforce to understand their skill strengths and weakness while the same percentage uses quantifiable metrics and benchmarking as part of their workforce strategy.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Workforce 2020 reveals that employees in Asia Pacific are career-driven, especially millennials, and what they need is not isolated training, but more leadership and career guidance,&rdquo; explained Fox-Martin. &ldquo;Armed with this sort of data and the right tools, companies will be better equipped to invest resources in the right people and programs that will drive retention and help meet business objectives. As millennials shape the future of work, every company must transform itself as an employer in order to compete for talent,&rdquo; he added.<br />

<br />

This is according to a global survey by Forum Asia Pacific and The Sales Management Association. The survey <em>Measuring Sales Management&rsquo;s Coaching Impact </em>revealed that a quarter of managers are still not coaching their sales teams despite admitting that it is important.<br />

<br />

The research represents data from over 200 companies, employing a total of more than 500,000 sales people.<br />

<br />

Experts in leadership development and sales performance training found that the main obstacles to effective coaching were that managers were either too busy to coach or that they didn&rsquo;t know how to coach.<br />

<br />

Others believe they weren&rsquo;t expected to coach or be held accountable for coaching.<br />

<br />

The report also showed that on average, sales coaching is given more to under-performers, new starters or those that specifically request it. This, revealing that managers only tend to coach more when they have to instead of doing it proactively as part of their daily management routine.<br />

<br />

Despite the evidence of poor coaching practice, those surveyed identified sales coaching as the most important of all sales in activities in improving the company&rsquo;s overall sales effectiveness.Coaching was rated ahead of sales training, new customer acquisition and cross-selling/up-selling, as being the activity to &nbsp;most influence sales performance.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Sales coaching is the single most impactful strategy that organisations can implement to increase sales effectiveness and ultimately, reach and even exceed targets. Our study found that high performing firms provide 15-20% more coaching compared to other firms and do so across salesperson levels,&rdquo; said Cynthia Stuckey, Managing Director of Forum Asia Pacific.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The report also showed that organisations are failing managers by not providing the basic elements of a successful coaching programme.<br />

<br />

&quot;Executive endorsement, management accountability, success measurement and pre-determined program objectives are all characteristics commonly found in the humblest of initiatives but we, together with Forum, have found that they remain missing in many sales coaching programs today,&quot; said Robert Kelly, chairman and founder of The Sales Management Association.","2014-09-29 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

<br />

This was revealed in the study <em>Towards More Relevant Reporting</em> conducted by PwC. The study the first of its kind examined 30 companies on the Straits Times Index (STI) .It was undertaken to understand where leading companies stand in regards to IR.<br />

<br />

The study also found that many of Singaporean companies were already including aspects of the IR framework, such as information about strategy, business models as well as risks and opportunities. However, the PwC noted that companies need to better link IR elements to create a more relevant value creation story to stakeholders.<br />

<br />

&nbsp;The IR framework was launched in December 2013 for companies to create greater insight to resources. The framework will be used to accelerate adoption of IR across the world. It applies principles and concepts focused on greater cohesion and efficiency to the reporting process, and adopting &lsquo;integrated thinking&rsquo; as a way of breaking down internal silos and reducing duplication.<br />

<br />

The framework is currently on trial in over 25 countries and Singapore&rsquo;s DBS Bank is one of the 100 companies world-wide testing the framework.<br />

<br />

While the study found that Singaporean companies were already disclosing some of the elements set out in the IR framework, it was also observed that there were many disclosures. there was still a lack of linkage between the information provided.&nbsp;It also pointed out that the strength of IR was not in individual disclosures for each content element but in the interconnectivity between all the content elements to tell an intergrated value creation story.<br />

<br />

Historical and financial reporting also seemed to remained the focus for companies in the study conducted and many more are still reluctant to have a more extensive discussion.&nbsp;There is also a lack of discussion around non-financial variables which affects a companies ability to deliver value.","2014-09-29 00:00:00",581,HRM,0,,1,581

<br />

The move has come after the Government accepted the recommendations of this &ldquo;promotional approach&rdquo; by the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers (Tricom) yesterday.<br />

<br />

The government is said to be &ldquo;considering positively&rdquo; the Tricom&rsquo;s recommendations to provide incentives to support companies that voluntarily re-employ their older workers beyond the age of 65. The Ministry of Manpower is working with tripartite partners and the Ministry of Finance on an incentive package to be announced early next year and made effective from 1 January 2015.<br />

<br />

Currently, companies are required by legislation to offer re-employment to workers who turn 62 till they turn 65. However, as part of its work to support the continued employment of older workers, the Tricom has been discussing the timeline for raising the re-employment age from 65 to 67 having consulted stakeholders such as union and employer groups.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;The overall aim is to maintain the employability of our older workers and keep as many of them turning 65 in employment as possible. The tripartite partners are committed to continue our promotional efforts to encourage more employers to re-employ beyond 65, and will also work with the government on possible incentives to support employers doing so,&quot; said Dr Amy Khor, Tricom Chairperson and Senior Minister of State for Manpower and Health.<br />

<br />

Minister of Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin accepted the Tricom&rsquo;s recommendations on behalf of the Government and said that &ldquo;starting with promotion is not new&rdquo;, noting that the same approach was adopted in 2012 when the Government first introduced the requirement for companies to re-employ workers till 65.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We are allowing companies adequate time to adjust before legislating, and will provide incentives for employers who voluntarily re-employ older workers beyond 65 ahead of it being legislated,&rdquo; he said.<br />

<br />

Meanwhile, Stephen Lee, Immediate Past President of Singapore National Employers Federation, said that the move was welcomed on employer&#39;s front with the timeframe given to help them manage their older workers.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;We therefore welcome the time given to help employers to manage their older workers over the next few years before legislation sets in. In particular, employers need to make the effort where necessary to restructure their wage system or to redesign jobs so that they can fulfil their extended re-employment obligations from 62 to 67. I urge employers to consider extending the re-employment of their employees beyond the age of 65 in the meantime to meet their manpower requirements,&rdquo; he said.","2014-09-30 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

&nbsp;<br />

This is according to the <em>Q3 Randstand Workmonitor, </em>global quarterly survey released yesterday. Results from the survey also show that a third of employees (36%) are not provided with relevant tools and training to work effectively in diverse teams.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Michael Smith, Country Director of Randstand Singapore noted that the world of work is changing amid the rapid growth of technology and virtual collaborations tools.<br />

<br />

Employees in Singapore not only work with colleagues who are physically located in the office, but they can easily link up with regional and global counterparts through faster internet connectivity and digital collaboration tools.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;In fact, our survey results show that seven in 10 (70 percent) employees now spend more time collaborating with colleagues than they did five years ago.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;This growth in collaboration and the need for greater connectivity means employers should ensure their employees are equipped with the necessary skills and tools to allow them to collaborate effectively &ndash; especially if they are working in different time zones,&rdquo; he said.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Results also show that while 67% employees believe they perform better in teams than individually, it takes specific social skills to do so, according to 91% of employees.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;This is especially so with today&rsquo;s increasingly diverse workforce where different age groups, genders and cultural backgrounds work alongside each other,&quot; Smith explained.<br />

<br />

&quot;Employees need to understand that everyone has different styles of working and communicating, and they need to be aware of these differences when working in a team.&quot;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The survey also found that diversity is an important factor at the workplace with 69% of employees believing that diverse teams always outperform teams with similar members.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;Diversity in a team encourages innovation and creativity and can help employees broaden their work experience as they will be exposed to a range of different perspectives and areas of expertise,&rdquo; Smith concluded.","2014-09-30 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581

India appears to rank high in happiness with 91% indicating that they were generally happy overall (very happy 55% and rather happy 36%).<br />

<br />

&ldquo;The Indian economy is showing signs of recovery with green shoots on the horizon. The growth in auto sales, exports, services sector, and healthy corporate performance &mdash; all seem to suggest that growth appears to have rebounded, &ldquo;said Amit Adarkar Managing Director for Ipsos India.<br />

<br />

Throughout the region, women seem to show greater levels of happiness overall. &nbsp;Women in India show the highest level of happiness.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

In Singapore, only 19% of women claim they are unhappy, against 29% of Singaporean men.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;With increasing number of women entering the workforce and rising independence, a multitude of avenues arise via which women can derive their happiness,&rdquo; said Miranda Cheung, Managing Director for Ipsos Singapore.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The survey also reveals that Japanese aged between 18 to 29 years old seem to be the unhappy group. Shunichi Uchida, Managing Director for Ipsos Japan noted that living in a highly developed society where poverty is low, &ldquo;it is typical of the Japanese culture to seek perfection in every aspect of their lives, including their happiness&rdquo;.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;With a general lack of satisfaction for the status quo, Japanese continue to strive for happier lives,&rdquo; he added.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Across the region, reasons seem to vary on contributing factors to happiness Own health/physical well-being was identified as the top contributing for happiness.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

In Singapore, citizens attributed unhappiness to their financial situation as well as their health. Singaporeans who are happy attributed happiness to factors such relationship with their partner or spouse (46%), good health (44%) and relationship with their parents (38%).<br />

&nbsp;<br />

According to the<em> Towers Watson 2014-15 Asia-Pacific Salary Budget Planning Report</em>, China (5.2%) and Vietnam (4.1%) will lead the way in East Asia for salary increases in 2015 after taking into account inflation, while Japan (0.6%) will see the smallest raises.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Across the region, from factory floor to senior management, employees will have pay raises equal to or higher than last year in percentage terms, with the exception of Taiwan, where the rate of increase will drop from 2.8% to 1.7% after inflation. In real terms, however, increases will be lower for 12 of 20 Asia Pacific economies covered in the survey.&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;The challenge for companies is to keep employees engaged and turnover down, while not getting caught up in a pay-inflation spiral,&rdquo; said Sambhav Rakyan, Data Services practice leader, Asia Pacific at Towers Watson. &ldquo;From our research we know that, whatever people say, salary is the number one driver for attracting and retaining highly skilled staff, so a fine balance needs to be found.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

In terms of overall increases &ndash; before inflation is factored in &ndash; India and Myanmar are also standouts for 2015. Vietnam is highest with 11%, followed by India at 10.8% and Myanmar 10%. Yet inflation erodes the real benefit in these countries to 4.1%, 3.5% and 3.3% respectively. China has an overall salary increase forecast of 8.3%, but this is supported by relatively low inflation expectations (3.1%).<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Hong Kong and Singapore are both set for overall increases of 4.5% in 2015, unchanged from 2014. However, after inflation, Singaporean employees will see more of that increase. In real terms salaries will rise 0.9% and 2.2% respectively.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Commenting on the overall findings, Rakyan said: &ldquo;As the salary-increase budgets stabilise in the region, companies need to carefully evaluate where to spend their limited funds. Differentiating between your crucial skill talent, high potentials and average performers is becoming more essential than ever to ensure best use of your budget.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&ldquo;We believe that a well-defined employee value proposition (EVP) is increasingly important as cost pressures and the talent shortage become more acute.

<br />

Creativity and innovation are two key ingredients for companies.<br />

<br />

Adobe has called on businesses to embrace creativity as a key organisational key performance indicator (KPI) that is on par with metrics such as revenues and brand equity.<br />

<br />

&ldquo;Businesses need to incorporate creativity as a key organisational KPI, on par with revenues and brand equity, as a measure of success.&rdquo; said Paul Robson, President of Adobe, Asia Pacific.<br />

<br />

Creativity has a dramatic impact on business results where innovative companies perform well in revenue, market share and competitive leadership.<br />

<br />

<br />

This was cited by&nbsp;Angela Koch, founder of Invitro Foundation, an Asian-based ideas and innovation consultancy in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<br />

She said customers want comfort level and simplicity in use than just a sophisticated product.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

Small organisations are underestimating the importance of emotional innovation where technology may not always yield the best result.<br />

<br />

Koch elaborated that SMEs can add value to their customers&rsquo; lives by incorporating the emotional approach to their business model.<br />

<br />

Furthermore, gaining access to technology may be harder for small businesses that face a high opportunity cost.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

Companies should be inspired to explore the human element that reaps benefits to their business.<br />

<br />

She highlighted that it will be challenging for smaller businesses to embrace the human element since workers are unfamiliar with this approach&nbsp;<br />

<br />

They are urged to focus on human aspects of innovation by looking at customers more as human beings and less as just customers.<br />

<br />

Employees in firms can undergo education and training programmes for a shift in mindset and attitude.","2014-10-02 00:00:00",581,HRM,1,,1,581
